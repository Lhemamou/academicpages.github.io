Hi everyone :)


I am Léo Hemamou, and welcome to my webpage!


I am currently a final year Ph.D. student. This magnificent journey has begun since October 2017 in collaboration between LIMSI-CNRS, Telecom ParisTech, and EASYRECRUE.


Research topics
======
My research work is pluridisciplinary as it combines IO psychology, machine learning, multimodal model, and social signal processing. I am especially interested in an automatic evaluation of hirability in the asynchronous job interview. Among the topics studied in the context of this Ph.D., I am focusing on personal selection, job interview, neural networks, multimodal representation, and interpretability.


The aim of my work is to :
1. evaluate automatically the hirability of a candidate based on his video answers 
2. infer social competencies of the candidate 
3. compare the results obtained through machine learning with results in IO psychology, especially for non-verbal behavior.
