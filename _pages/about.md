======
Hi everyone :) <br />


I am Léo Hemamou and welcome to my personal webpage !



I am currrently a final year PhD student. This wonderful journey has begun since October 2017 in collaboration between LIMSI-CNRS, Telecom ParisTech and EASYRECRUE.


Research topics
======
My research work is pluridisciplanary as it combines IO psychology, machine learning, multimodal model and social signal processing. I am especially interested in automatic evaluation of hirability in asynchronous job interview. Among the topics studied in the context of this PhD, i am focusing on personal selection, job interview, neural networks, multimodal representation and interpretability. 

The aim of my work is to 1) evaluate automatically the hirability of a candidate based on his video answers 2) infer social competencies of the candidate 3) compare the results obtained through machine learning with results in IO psychology, especially for non-verbal behaviour.
